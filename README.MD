# Line Follower

Arduino Code for the Line Follower Project of the IED class at RPI, Fall 2018.

## Notes

* Use a power supply module to power the motor.
* The L293D has a chance of burning out.
* Power the IR receiver with Arduino instead of the power supply, because the motors be draw too much power.
